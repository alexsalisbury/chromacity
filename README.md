# Chroma City

"Chroma is the 'colorfulness of an area judged as a proportion of the brightness of a similarly illuminated area that appears white or highly transmitting.'" - Wikipedia

A semi-fancy mssql for myself.

A semi-fancy sql with a bit of web to make debugging easier by making it simple to print out table contents.

A more rounded data backend starter

A preferred default for a slimmer redis install. Great for redis university.

A more robust redis + sql prototype databank
